# Phone-Orientation-Visualization

This repository contains an implementation of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm for sensor fusion of Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data to accurately estimate a phone orientation (Or anyother object that has an IMU). The resulting orientation data can be visualized using a Pygame-based interface, providing an intuitive representation of the device's spatial positioning.
